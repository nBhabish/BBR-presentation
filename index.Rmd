# Impact of China's Retaliatory Tariffs on Democratic Vote Share Between 2016 and 2018

# Motivation:

On July 6, 2018, President Trump’s administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods, including televisions, aircraft parts, and medical devices. In retaliation, China responded by imposing tariffs on agricultural products. China’s decision to impose retaliatory tariffs has had an unfortunate consequence on the agricultural producers of the US- particularly on soybean producers. Many farmers across different states in the U.S. support the Republican party and President Trump.

#Research Question:


Are the soybean producing counties more likely to shift their votes to Democratic candidates after China's retaliatory tariffs right before the midterm election?

class: middle, left

# Method:

- Factors that contribute towards the reduction or growth in Change in Democratic Vote Share from 2016 to 2018 is estimated using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression.  
  
- Dependent variable is Change in Democratic Vote Share from 2016 to 2018.  
  
- Independent variables include:
  
  1. Percent change in Soybean production from 2018 to 2019
    
  2. Percent change in Corn production from 2018 to 2019
    
  3. Median Household Income of 2018
    
  4. Unemployment Rate of 2018
    
  5. Acres of Soybean planted in 2018

  6. Change in Republican Vote Share from 2008 and 2010

# Data Sources:

- Data collected are county-level data.  
  
- Corn and Soybean production and acres planted data comes from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  
  
- Election data for House of Representative comes from Secretary of State website from each state secretary’s website.
  
- Our Median Household Income and Unemployment rate data comes from either American Community Survey (ACS) or Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

.pull-right[


- Plugging in a negative value for Change in Soybean production in the equation below shows a positive association with Change in Democratic Vote Share from 2016 to 2018.

- This means if there was a decrease in Soybean production from 2018 to 2019, then there would be a positive association in Change in Democratic Vote Share from 2016 to 2018.  

$ChangeInDemVoteShare$ = $-0.026$ - $0.082ChangeInSoyProd$ + $0.037ChangeInCornProd$ + $0.005MedianHHIncome$ + $0.002UnempRate$ + $0.005AcresOfSoyPlanted$

# Limitations:

1. USDA has not reported soybean and corn production data for many counties in 2018 and 2019 which reduces the number of observations when regressing the dependent variable to the independent variable in the model.
 - A follow-up analysis shows that there is no systematic differences between counties with and without missing data.

2. The votes drop off from Presidential Election to Midterm Election is not accounted for in the model.

# Conclusion:
.can-edit[
1. Changes in Soybean production from 2018 to 2019 had an effect on the Change in Democratic vote share from 2016 to 2018. A decrease in Soybean production from 2018 to 2019 is associated with an increase in Democratic voting.   
  
2. This effect is slightly reduced as soon as historical voting patterns is controlled for. Historical voting patterns, the control variable, is accounted for by Change in Republican Vote Share from 2008 to 2010. 
  
3. Likewise, when  controlling for historical voting pattern, the median household income was able to explain some of the variance in the dependent variable.
  
5. Lastly, our analysis is only able to explain very little about the variance in change in Democratic Vote Share from 2016 to 2018 since the $R^2$ is very low.
